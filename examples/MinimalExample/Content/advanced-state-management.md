Managing state in a complex Blazor application can be challenging. This post explores different patterns and libraries to help maintain predictable state across your application.

## The Challenge with State Management

As your Blazor application grows, passing parameters between components becomes unwieldy. You need a more robust solution for:

- Sharing state between unrelated components
- Preserving state across page navigations
- Tracking state changes predictably
- Managing side effects

## Approach 1: Dependency Injection with Services

The simplest approach uses services registered with the DI container:

```csharp
public class WeatherService
{
    public List<WeatherForecast> Forecasts { get; private set; } = new();
    public event Action? OnChange;
    
    public async Task LoadForecasts()
    {
        // Load data
        Forecasts = await _httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync<List<WeatherForecast>>("api/weather");
        OnChange?.Invoke();
    }
}
```

## Approach 2: Using Fluxor for Unidirectional Data Flow

For more complex applications, the Flux/Redux pattern implemented by Fluxor provides predictable state management:

1. State is read-only and only changed by dispatching actions
2. Reducers are pure functions that transform state
3. State changes flow in a single direction

## Conclusion

Choose your state management approach based on application complexity. Simple services work for smaller applications, while Fluxor or similar libraries shine in larger applications where predictable state updates are critical.
