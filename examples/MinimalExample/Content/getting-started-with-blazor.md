Blazor is a framework for building interactive client-side web UI with .NET:

- Use C# instead of JavaScript
- Share server and client-side code
- Leverage the .NET ecosystem

## Prerequisites

To get started with Blazor, you'll need:

1. .NET SDK 8.0 or later
2. A code editor (Visual Studio, VS Code, Rider, etc.)
3. Basic knowledge of C# and HTML

## Creating Your First Blazor App

Let's create a simple Blazor application:

```bash
dotnet new blazor -o MyFirstBlazorApp
cd MyFirstBlazorApp
dotnet run
```

Navigate to `https://localhost:5001` in your browser to see your application running!

## Understanding the Project Structure

A Blazor project consists of:

- Components (`.razor` files)
- Static assets
- Services and other C# code

## Next Steps

In the next article, we'll explore Blazor components in depth and learn how to create interactive UIs.
