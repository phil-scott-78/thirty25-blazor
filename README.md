# Thirty25, Phil Scott's Blog

## Based on BlazorStatic Minimal Blog

A minimalistic blog template designed to get your Blazor-based blog up and running in no time. This project is based on
the [BlazorStatic](https://github.com/tesar-tech/BlazorStatic) library to convert a Blazor app into a static site
generator

## Running

`dotnet watch` - run and watch the content. Markdown changes are copied automatically along with razor and styling issues
`dotnet run -- build` builds the static site to the `output` folder for deployment
