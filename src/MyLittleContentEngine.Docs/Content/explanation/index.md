The explanation section provides understanding-oriented discussions about MyLittleContentEngine. These articles help you understand not just how to use the framework, but why it works the way it does and the thinking behind its design decisions.

## What You'll Understand

These explanations will give you deeper insight into:

- The architectural decisions that shape MyLittleContentEngine
- Core concepts and how they relate to each other
- The reasoning behind specific design choices
- How different components work together
- The philosophy and principles guiding development

## Key Concepts

### [Core Concepts](core-concepts.md)
Understand the fundamental building blocks of MyLittleContentEngine and how they work together to create a cohesive content management system.

### [Content Pipeline](content-pipeline.md)
Learn how content flows through the system, from markdown files to rendered HTML, and the transformation steps along the way.

### [Static Site Generation](static-site-generation.md)
Explore the principles and implementation of static site generation in MyLittleContentEngine and why it's beneficial for content sites.

- **Extension Points** - Where and how you can customize behavior
- **Type Safety Approach** - How strong typing improves the developer experience

## Design Philosophy

MyLittleContentEngine is built around several key principles:

### Developer Experience First
Every design decision prioritizes the developer experience. This means:
- Strong typing wherever possible
- Clear, predictable APIs
- Excellent tooling support
- Meaningful error messages

### Performance by Default
The framework is designed to be fast without requiring optimization:
- Efficient caching strategies
- Minimal runtime overhead
- Static generation for maximum performance
- Lazy loading where appropriate

### Blazor Native
Rather than adapting existing static site generators, MyLittleContentEngine is built specifically for the Blazor ecosystem:
- Native integration with Blazor Server and WebAssembly
- Full access to the .NET ecosystem
- Seamless component integration
- Natural C# development patterns

### Flexibility Within Structure
The framework provides sensible defaults while allowing customization:
- Convention-based configuration
- Extensible processing pipeline
- Pluggable components
- Clear override points

## Understanding vs. Implementation

These explanation articles focus on the "why" rather than the "how". If you're looking for specific implementation details:

- See [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) for step-by-step learning
- Check [How-To Guides](../how-to/index.md) for specific problem solutions  
- Reference [API Documentation](../reference/index.md) for detailed specifications
