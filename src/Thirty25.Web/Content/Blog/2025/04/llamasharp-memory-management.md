In our [first post](getting-started-with-llamasharp), we covered the basics of setting up LlamaSharp and running a local
LLM. In the [second post](llamasharp-sampling-pipeline), we explored how to fine-tune the sampling pipeline for optimal
text generation. Now, let's now examine one of the most critical aspects of local LLM deployment: **memory management**.

If you've experimented with different models and context lengths, you've likely encountered situations where your GPU
ran out of memory or performance degraded significantly with larger contexts. Today, we'll demystify these issues and
explore strategies to keep your LLMs running efficiently on consumer hardware.

## Understanding LLM Memory Usage

Before we dive into optimization techniques, it's important to understand what consumes memory when running an LLM:

1. **Model Weights**: The parameters that define the neural network itself
2. **KV Cache**: Memory used to store intermediate values during text generation
3. **Temporary Buffers**: Working memory needed for computations
4. **Application Overhead**: Memory used by your .NET application and the OS

Let's examine each of these components in detail.

## Model Weights: Size Matters

The base memory requirement comes from the model weights themselves. As we discussed in our first post, models come in
various sizes (1B, 4B, 7B, 13B, etc.) and quantization levels (Q2_K to Q8_0).

### Understanding Quantization

Quantization is essentially a compression technique for neural networks. In simple terms, quantization
reduces the precision of numbers used to store the model's weights:

* **Original weights**: Typically stored as 32-bit or 16-bit floating-point numbers (FP32/FP16)
* **Quantized weights**: Converted to lower precision formats (8-bit, 4-bit, or even 2-bit integers)

Think of it like image compression:

* A high-resolution 24-bit color image (like FP16) has beautiful detail but large file size
* A compressed 8-bit color image (like Q8_0) looks nearly identical but takes much less space
* A heavily compressed 2-bit image (like Q2_K) shows noticeable quality loss but is tiny in comparison

Here's a quick reference for approximate memory requirements of common model sizes:

| Model Size | FP16 (16-bit) | Q8_0 (8-bit) | Q6_K (6-bit) | Q4_K (4-bit) | Q2_K (2-bit) |
|------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1B         | ~2 GB         | ~1 GB        | ~750 MB      | ~500 MB      | ~250 MB      |
| 4B         | ~8 GB         | ~4 GB        | ~3 GB        | ~2 GB        | ~1 GB        |
| 7B         | ~14 GB        | ~7 GB        | ~5.25 GB     | ~3.5 GB      | ~1.75 GB     |
| 13B        | ~26 GB        | ~13 GB       | ~9.75 GB     | ~6.5 GB      | ~3.25 GB     |
| 34B        | ~68 GB        | ~34 GB       | ~25.5 GB     | ~17 GB       | ~8.5 GB      |

This is why I suggested in our first post to follow the rule of thumb: "choose the parameter-sized model whose Q6_K file
size lines up with your VRAM size minus 4GB." Those extra 4GB are primarily needed for the next component: the KV cache.

## The KV Cache: Memory's Hidden Consumer

The KV (Key-Value) cache is perhaps the most important memory component to understand when optimizing LLMs, yet it's
often overlooked.

### What is the KV Cache?

The KV (Key-Value) cache is a memory optimization technique that stores intermediate calculation results to
avoid redundant work.

To understand this better, let's break down how an LLM works:

1. When processing text, the model breaks it into tokens (roughly word fragments)
2. For each token, the model needs to look at all previous tokens to understand context
3. This "looking at previous tokens" involves computing two sets of data for each token:
    - "Keys" (K): Think of these as search indexes or identifiers
    - "Values" (V): Think of these as the actual information or content

Without a KV cache, every time the model generates a new token, it would need to recompute all these K and V data points
for every token from the beginning - extremely inefficient!

Instead, think of the KV cache like a database index. When the model processes the sentence "The capital of France is",
it computes and stores the K and V data for each token. Then, when generating the next token ("Paris"), it simply:

1. Retrieves the already calculated K and V data from the cache
2. Only computes new K and V data for the most recent token
3. Uses all this information to predict the next token

This is similar to how a database keeps indexes to avoid repeatedly scanning entire tables. The KV cache is like a
working memory that allows the model to efficiently build on previous calculations.

### Why the KV Cache Demands So Much Memory

The memory required for the KV cache can be calculated approximately with:

```
KV cache size ≈ num_layers × 2 × hidden_dim × context_length × bytes_per_weight
```

Where:

- `num_layers` is the number of transformer layers (varies by model size)
- `2` accounts for both key and value vectors
- `hidden_dim` is the dimension of the hidden state (typically 4096 for 7B models, 5120 for 13B, etc.)
- `context_length` is the maximum number of tokens you're allowing
- `bytes_per_weight` is typically 2 for half-precision (FP16) or 4 for full precision (FP32)

For example, a 7B model with 32 layers, hidden dimension of 4096, and 4K context length in FP16 would require:

```
32 × 2 × 4096 × 4096 × 2 bytes ≈ 2.1 GB
```

But increase that context to 32K, and suddenly you need:

```
32 × 2 × 4096 × 32768 × 2 bytes ≈ 17.2 GB
```

That's just for the KV cache! Add the model weights, and you can see why even a 24GB GPU struggles with large models and
long contexts.

### How Context Length Affects Memory

As you can see from the formula, KV cache memory scales linearly with context length. This is why you might be able to
load a 13B model with a 2K context but run out of memory when increasing to an 8K context.

Let's look at typical KV cache sizes for a 7B model at different context lengths:

| Context Length | KV Cache Size (FP16) |
|----------------|----------------------|
| 512            | ~268 MB              |
| 2,048          | ~1.1 GB              |
| 4,096          | ~2.1 GB              |
| 8,192          | ~4.3 GB              |
| 16,384         | ~8.6 GB              |
| 32,768         | ~17.2 GB             |

This explains why the logs in our first post showed such large KV buffer sizes with the default 131K context length!

## Performance Impact of Large Contexts

Beyond memory constraints, large contexts significantly impact performance for two key reasons:

1. **Attention Complexity**: The self-attention mechanism has **quadratic complexity** with respect to sequence length.
   Each token needs to attend to all previous tokens, so doubling your context length quadruples the computation needed.

2. **Cache Misses**: With larger KV caches, you're more likely to experience cache misses at the hardware level, further
   degrading performance.

Here's a rough guideline for how context length affects token generation speed on consumer hardware:

| Context Length | Approximate Performance Impact |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| 512            | Baseline (fastest)             |
| 2,048          | 25-30% slower than baseline    |
| 4,096          | 50-60% slower than baseline    |
| 8,192          | 75-85% slower than baseline    |
| 16,384+        | >90% slower than baseline      |

This is why you might observe your model generating 30 tokens/second with a short context, but dropping to 5-10
tokens/second with a very long context.

## Real-world Performance Benchmarks

To give you a concrete idea of what to expect, here are some benchmarks running Gemma-3 Models (Q6_K quantization) on my
RTX 4080 SUPER with 16GB VRAM:

| Model Size | Context | Layers on GPU | Loading Time | First Token | Tokens/sec | Max VRAM Usage |
|------------|---------|---------------|--------------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 4B         | 2K      | All           | 2.3s         | 83ms        | 45         | 4.1 GB         |
| 4B         | 8K      | All           | 2.4s         | 110ms       | 28         | 5.8 GB         |
| 12B        | 2K      | All           | 5.8s         | 112ms       | 32         | 9.2 GB         |
| 12B        | 8K      | All           | 6.1s         | 142ms       | 18         | 12.8 GB        |
| 27B        | 2K      | 32/50         | 10.2s        | 165ms       | 21         | 15.3 GB        |
| 27B        | 8K      | 24/50         | 10.8s        | 254ms       | 9          | 15.7 GB        |

A few observations:

- First token latency increases with both model size and context length
- Generation speed (tokens/sec) drops dramatically with larger contexts
- Memory usage increases more with context for larger models

## Practical Guidelines for Consumer Hardware

Based on these benchmarks and principles, here are my recommendations for different hardware configurations:

### Entry-Level (4-8GB VRAM)

- **Models**: Stick to 1B-4B models with Q4_K quantization
- **Context**: Keep context under 2K tokens
- **Settings**:
  ```csharp
  var parameters = new ModelParams(modelPath)
  {
      ContextSize = 2048,
      GpuLayerCount = 16,  // Adjust based on your specific GPU
      BatchSize = 64       // Lower batch size to reduce memory spikes
  };
  ```

### Mid-Range (8-12GB VRAM)

- **Models**: 7B models with Q6_K or 13B with Q4_K
- **Context**: Up to 4K tokens comfortably
- **Settings**:
  ```csharp
  var parameters = new ModelParams(modelPath)
  {
      ContextSize = 4096,
      GpuLayerCount = -1,  // Use all layers on GPU
      BatchSize = 128      // Balanced batch size
  };
  ```

### High-End (16GB+ VRAM)

- **Models**: 13B with Q6_K or up to 34B with Q4_K
- **Context**: 8K-16K tokens depending on model size
- **Settings**:
  ```csharp
  var parameters = new ModelParams(modelPath)
  {
      ContextSize = 8192,
      GpuLayerCount = -1,     // Use all layers on GPU for smaller models
      // For 34B+ models, use partial offloading:
      // GpuLayerCount = 40,  // Adjust based on available VRAM
      BatchSize = 256         // Larger batch size for throughput
  };
  ```

## Understanding the Memory vs. Performance Tradeoff

When optimizing LLMs on consumer hardware, you're always balancing three competing factors:

1. **Model Quality**: Larger models and better quantization generally produce better outputs
2. **Context Length**: Longer contexts provide more information but consume more memory
3. **Inference Speed**: How quickly the model generates text

Here's a simple decision tree to guide your optimization process:

1. Start with the largest model that fits in your VRAM with Q6_K quantization
2. Set context length based on your use case (2K for instructions, 4K+ for document processing)
3. If you run out of memory:
    - First, reduce context length if possible
    - If not, try GPU offloading (reduce `GpuLayerCount`)
    - If still insufficient, move to a smaller model or lower quantization
4. If generation is too slow:
    - Reduce context length
    - Consider a smaller model with full GPU utilization
    - As a last resort, use lower quantization (Q4_K or Q2_K)

## When Context Overflows: Understanding LLM Memory Limitations

Of course, reducing context size has its downside. Let's examine what happens in different overflow scenarios and 
how to handle them effectively.

### Input Overflow - Too Much Data In

When you feed more tokens into the model than its configured context size allows, several things can happen:

```csharp
// This might seem fine initially...
var text = File.ReadAllText("very-large-document.txt");
var result = await model.InferAsync(text);
```

Depending on LlamaSharp's configuration and the underlying llama.cpp version, you might see:

1. **Silent Truncation**: The model simply discards tokens beyond the context limit, starting from the beginning
2. **Exception Thrown**: An explicit error about exceeding context length. You'll often see this error with LlamaSharp
   as a `NoKvSlot` exception.
3. **Degraded Performance**: The model attempts to process everything but slows to a crawl

The first case is particularly dangerous because the model might lose critical information without warning. For
instance, if your prompt structure is:

```
<SYSTEM PROMPT>
<DOCUMENT>
<QUESTION>
```

And the document is massive, the system prompt might get truncated, causing the model to ignore your instructions
entirely.

### Goldfish Memory - Generation Exceeds Context

A more subtle issue occurs when you generate more tokens than the model can "remember":

```csharp
var prompt = "Write a comprehensive essay on the history of computing";
// Model starts generating and keeps going...
```

Since the context window acts like a sliding window, when generation exceeds available context, the model begins to "
forget" the earliest parts of the conversation, including:

1. Your original instructions
2. Earlier parts of its own generation
3. Key details from the prompt

This leads to:

- **Topic Drift**: The model gradually wanders off-topic
- **Contradictions**: The model makes claims that conflict with earlier statements it can no longer "see"
- **Repetition Loops**: Without memory of what it already said, the model may start repeating itself

You'll see this most often when asking for long-form content like essays, stories, or code implementations. 

## Conclusion

Memory management is perhaps the most critical aspect of running LLMs efficiently on consumer hardware. Understanding
the interplay between model size, quantization, context length, and the KV cache gives you the tools to make informed
trade-offs.

With the right optimization strategies, even modest consumer hardware can run surprisingly capable language models. My
RTX 4080 SUPER can comfortably run a Gemma-3 12B model with 8K context, which would have been unthinkable just a couple
of years ago.

As LlamaSharp and llama.cpp continue to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated memory optimization techniques.
Keep an eye on new releases, as they often bring significant performance improvements.

In our next post, we'll explore techniques for working with documents and implementing retrieval-augmented generation (
RAG) using LlamaSharp. Until then, happy optimizing!
